<h2>Description</h2>
The blog backend application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It follows a RESTful API architecture and utilizes the Mongoose ODM for interacting with the MongoDB database.

The application provides the following features:

User registration with name, email, and password.
User login with email and password.
Retrieval of all users.

<h3>Blog Management</h3>

Creation of blogs with a title, description, image, and associated user.
Retrieval of all blogs.
Update of blog title and description.
